**Subject**: Jesse from CI Notify

Hey there ðŸ‘‹ - my name's Jesse and I'm reaching out because you've used
cinotify (https://www.cinotify.cc), and I want to get some feedback from
you on how I can improve the product.

I have several ideas for new features and am curious if any of these
resonate with you:

- Sending SMS messages from a CI pipeline
- Email configuration enhancements
  - multiple recipients (cc)
  - hidden recipients (bcc)
  - attachments
- Reply to a notification to trigger a Pull Request action
  - rerun a flakey test-suite
  - merge a pull request
  - close a pull request
- Benchmark CI performance
  - number of runs per branch
  - time spent from start to build completion
- Native Integrations
  - Microsoft Teams
  - Zapier

What do you think? Is there anything you'd love to be able to do inside
of a CI/CD pipeline that CI Notify might be able to help out with?

I manually typed and sent this email, so unfortunately there is no
unsubscribe link, but if you'd rather not hear from me again, just don't
reply! Otherwise, I look forward to hearing your feedback.

Thanks for helping shape the future of CI Notify!

Jesse
